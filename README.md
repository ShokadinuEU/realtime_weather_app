## Weather App

 - To build the app I've use cli create-react-app.
 - To fetch data from the api I've made use of axios library.
 - As for the style I've use materialize-ui to create styled components.

##### I'll gonna submit the project on this stage due to the fact that this is how far I could get in the time given.
