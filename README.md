  ## My Weather App - test

  ##### I'll gonna submit the project at this stage, due to the fact that, this is how far I could get it done in the given time.

  ##### Building the app stepps / tools

 - My codding style goes like this:
    + First I would like to implement the UI.
    + Secondly I'll work on the logical/functionality.
    + And thirdly on optimization.

 - As for tools used for this project I mention:
    + I've used the create-react-app CLI for installing React.js
    + I've used Matherialize CSS for styling the components
    + To fetch the data I've use axios library


  #### Now what I would change / correct if I invest more time on it.

 + First, I would work more on functionality to fullfill the main requirement of the task. Things like the progress bar to dynamic refresh / fetch the new data from the server at the time mention, and aswell as dealing with showing the the days as it was on the design.

 + Second, I would've add some animations / smooth transition when change the data.

 + Third, I would like to add an acordion effect on 5 days forecast as when the used click on one of them to show some more details sach as wind speed, chance to rain or whatever's left on the api.

 + Fourth, I would like to restructure the whole code separing the bussiness logic from the UI components and add some comments for a better navigation through the project for myself and others who may work in the future on it.
